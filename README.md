Weather Data- Only has data from January 1, 2017 to May 5, 2018

Bike Data - Only has data starting on June 28, 2017

For simplicity sake I only look at the data between June 28, 2017 and May 5, 2018. If I had more time I could find either more weather 
data or bike data in order to match the other and get more data points.  

Since the scope of this question was somewhat large I focused on three smaller questions:
	1. If the pattern of riders between a rainy and non rainy day changes between months.
	2. If the pattern of riders between a rainy and non rainy day changes between stations.
	3. If on a rainy day the percentage of riders changes as the percipitation changes. 

With more time, there are many difference questions that could have been answered, and some 
of them came up while investigating the three above. For example:
	1. The stations where there were a difference- were they locations similar?
	2. Do the number of riders gradually increase in the days after a rain or is it a spike? 
	3. Are there other events happening in SF that account for changes in riding pattern - 
           such as a sporting game?
	4. After stratifying to time of day (instead of just day as I did above) do we see changes
	   from weather patterns? 

There are also better visuals that can be created with more time. For a problem like this the 
R Shiny dashboard would be very helpful is showing differences (rather than just ggplot). 

Overall I think what I did is just a glance into what I could have done!

For view: I attached an html to the submission link and also I knit the final result to a pdf, which is in the repo!
